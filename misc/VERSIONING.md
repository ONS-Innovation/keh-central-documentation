# Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning follows the format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. 2.1.3)

Each number has specific meaning:

- MAJOR version: Incremented for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version: Incremented for backwards-compatible new functionality
- PATCH version: Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata can be appended:

- Alpha/Beta/RC tags: For pre-release versions (e.g. 1.0.0-alpha.1)
- Build metadata: Additional build information (e.g. 1.0.0+20130313144700)

Examples:

- 1.0.0 - Initial release
- 1.0.1 - Bug fixes
- 1.1.0 - New features added
- 2.0.0 - Breaking changes

This versioning scheme helps developers and users understand the impact of updates and manage dependencies effectively.
